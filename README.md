Prior to study Master, I have working experiences in IT infrastructure administration, architect, IT service management, IT support and in Project Management. I am also an ITIL V4 certified and well versed with agile methods.

In my past roles, I have been working in multiple IT projects in multiple domains like in manufacturing, textile and logistics, Banking, Finance and retail, all my past experiences always needed me to have a close collaboration with cross-functional team, vendors, and stakeholder and handling my own projects.
 
I have significant experience in Python, C programming, Bash, PowerShell, VB Script. I have excellent data analytical and visualization skills using, python, MATLAB, POWERBI and in Excel. I also have solid hands-on experience in ServiceNow, Zendesk and in Jira ITSM tool.

I have been working in multiple IT projects in multiple domains in Banking, Finance, retail, manufacturing, textile and logistics. All my past experiences always needed me to have a close collaboration with cross-functional team, vendors, and stakeholder and handling my own projects. I have excellent knowledge on project Management and delivery. 

I am fluent in English, and I joined a Finnish course from Helsingin työväenopisto 7 months back, hence my Finnish language is beginner level. But I am trying hard to make it fluent in couple of months.
 
Outside work, I am jolly person having great interest in technology, photography, music and travels.
 
Meanwhile I am also eager to contribute my skills and expertise to your organisation that values innovation, teamwork, and continuous improvement. Hence, I am looking for a part/full time jobs/summer Job/Internship.
 
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks & regards,
