# Sumit_Resume
I am a motivated and technically skilled Master’s student in Smart Energy with a major in Robotics at the University of Vaasa,
combining a solid academic foundation with hands-on experience in machine vision, machine learning, robotics, and automation.
With a professional background in IT cloud infrastructure management, project management, and IT system administration, I bring
a unique combination of technical expertise and cross-functional experience.
I am currently transitioning from IT infrastructure into the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, aiming to
leverage my background to excel in the development of intelligent systems and automation solutions.
I am passionate about sustainable technologies, smart city innovations, and the integration of intelligent systems that create
meaningful impact. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to forward-thinking organizations that value innovation,
sustainability, and real-world outcomes.

NB: 
**I hold a long-term, valid Type A work permit (specialist category) in Finland and am open to relocation.**
